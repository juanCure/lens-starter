          <p>In this work, we present a set of 38 rasters, with a 30 x 30 m resolution, showing the cumulated subsidence over a large portion of Mexico City metropolitan area, from 20021122 (yyyymmdd) to 20070316. Annual average subsidence rates in Mexico City, one of the world most populated urban areas, reaches up to 0.38 m/yr, mainly due to soil compaction led by overexploitation of the Mexico Basin aquifer. To accurately map the spatial and temporal evolution of subsidence, a set of 38 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from ENVISAT mission, has been processed through Small BASeline interferometry and the results have been formatted as rasters that can be analyzed on any Geographic Information System. Moreover, the whole set of rasters can be visualized as interactive animated series of cumulated subsidence maps through the journal platform.</p>

          <p>En este trabajo, se presentan 38 rasters, con resolución de 30 x 30 m, que muestran la subsidencia acumulada sobre una gran porción de la Ciudad de México, desde 20021122 (aaaammdd), hasta 20070316. Las tasas de subsidencia promedio anual en la Ciudad de México, una de las urbanizaciones más pobladas del mundo, alcanzan hasta 0.38 m/año, principalmente debido a la compactación del suelo, provocada por la sobreexplotación del acuífero del Valle de México. Para mapear con exactitud la evolución espacial y temporal de la subsidencia, se procesó mediante interferometría con líneas de base pequeñas, un conjunto de 38 imágenes de Radar de Apertura Sintética de la misión ENVISAT. Los resultados fueron formateados como rasters que pueden ser analizados en cualquier Sistema de Información Geográfica. Además, el conjunto completo de rasters puede ser visualizado a través de la plataforma en línea de la revista, como serie de tiempo animada e interactiva de la subsidencia acumulada.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Maps constitute a useful tool to analyze subsidence taking place in large urban areas like Mexico City, where water pumping exceed the aquifer replenishment. Moreover, when maps are updated in time, the spatial and time evolution of subsidence can be estimated, constituting a great tool to asses the generation of strategies to cope with the consequences of this kind of hazard. Subsidence measurements, can be achieved by using several techniques including leveling, Global Positioning System (GPS), extensometers, piezometers, Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), cameras carried by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and Synthethic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR). In a way, all these techniques can be complementary, however, most of them (e.g. leveling, GPS, extensometers, piezometers) require in-situ tool installation and measuring; besides, spatial resolution can be poor, because measurements can be obtained only at a few locations. Mapping, using cameras carried by UAV, can be done when the extension of the study area is not very large (<xref rid="ID06769d5e-e22c-4f4b-9fe7-ddc0f7f8058e" ref-type="bibr" id="IDfd747542-9282-41c0-bab1-e2bb8fccf0ed">Carrera-Hernández, Levresse, Lacan, &amp; Aranda-Gómez, 2016</xref>). However, when subsidence has to be measured over large areas, InSAR is a valuable tool, because is usually less expensive than LIDAR or obtaining measurements from techniques based on labor intensive surveys. Moreover, results from InSAR can be used as a first step to guide the subsequent installation of GPS, leveling and extensometer/piezometer, over specific and limited areas (<xref rid="ID39113f32-ea65-4853-af2b-5eb1cd4671dd" ref-type="bibr" id="

        <p>InSAR has been successfully applied to monitor subsidence (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" id="cite1">Amelung, Galloway, Bell, Zebker, &amp; Laczniak, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="IDd53f5391-9a0e-4fe0-878a-e7ad1a7c0cff" ref-type="bibr" id="cite2">Cavalié, Doin, Lasserre, &amp; Briole, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" id="cite3">Hooper, Zebker, Segall, &amp; Kampes, 2004</xref>). For this purpose, it is possible to use one of the following two approaches. The first one, is known as Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR), and consists in making interfere two images, taken at two different times from the same study area, to measure the deformation occurred on the time span between the acquisition of the two images. The second one, is known as Advanced InSAR (A-DInSAR) and overcomes most of the problems encountered by DInSAR (e.g. atmospheric phase contribution modeling and removal), using several images. Among principal A-DInSAR techniques are the processing of Small BASelines interferograms (SBAS), and the Permanent or Persistent Scatterers (PS). Both of them, allow to generate deformation time series: a) over the pixels that constitute the images, when using SBAS, and b) over targets with a level of coherence constant in time (e.g. buildings or pinnacles), when using PS (<xref rid="ID17be9b67-69df-44d7-93e2-98c1d1fa2499" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7ad3e23c-7611-42d2-9be2-60c7ed275118">Del Ventisette, 2013</xref>). Examples of DInSAR and A-DinSAR applied to subsidence due to water pumping were presented by <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" id="cite1"> Berardino , Fornaro, Lanari, &amp; Sansosti, 2002 </xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" id="cite1">Schmidt &amp; Bürgmann, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" id="cite1">Usai, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" id="cite1">Ferretti, Prati, &amp; Rocca, 2000</xref>;<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" id="cite1">Galloway &amp; Hoffmann, 2007 </xref> and <xref rid="ID39113f32-ea65-4853-af2b-5eb1cd4671dd" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd3f2117f-1faa-4ffe-85a4-f9c04dfbf48e">Galloway &amp; Burbey, 2011</xref>.</p>

It is important to note that, even if these works calculated time series of subsidence over the city, the corresponding images were not presented or available.</p>

        <p><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" id="cite1">López-Quiroz, Doin, Tupin, Briole, &amp; Nicolas, 2009</xref>, used SBAS (A-DInSAR) interferometry to calculate the time series and annual average subsidence, of each 30 x 30 m pixel, in Mexico City metropolitan area, for a time span of 4 years and 4 months, from 20021122 to 20070316. However, they only presented the annual average subsidence map. This work makes available the complete database of the time series presented by <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" id="cite1">López-Quiroz et al. 2009</xref>,  and offers an interactive animated visualization of the series of subsidence maps, which can be seen on the Terra Digitalis platform.

      <title>Mexico City subsidence</title>
        <p>The Mexico City metropolitan area extends over 1200 km2 and is considered the third most populated urban agglomeration in the world (<xref rid="ID8d2f17fd-7203-4e88-9e1e-b49a45e282a7" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa2409dc0-f625-433a-ad74-55231301af42">Benson-Lira, Georgescu, Kaplan, &amp; Vivoni, 2016</xref>).

      <title>Hydrogeological setting</title>
        <p>Mexico City is located into the southern part of an endoreic basin which hydrogeological setting can be simplified as an aquifer and an aquitard. The aquifer, is composed of Quaternary alluvial deposits, its depth is spatially variable and can reach a maximum of 800 m (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" id="cite1">Herrera, Martínez &amp; Hernandez, 1989</xref>).

Lacustrine deposits of the aquitard are mainly composed of extremely compressible clays that undergo compaction because of the high water extraction from the aquifer, resulting in widespread subsidence (<xref rid="IDf26b7c1f-bdba-486f-8a51-953f3b69406f" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7475759e-3635-4b95-b1ff-6421bd264981">Carrera- Hern&#225;ndez &amp; Gaskin, 2007</xref>).</p>

      <title>Methodology</title>
        <p>To analyze the temporal and spatial evolution of the Mexico City subsidence phenomena, a set of 38 SAR images from the ENVISAT satellite, provided by the European Space Agency and covering the 20021122 to 20070316 time span, were acquired and processed. A 3-arc second sampled, void filled, Digital Elevation Model from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (<xref rid="IDf8c94d0e-587f-49f9-adc4-ff2cef6b13c0" ref-type="bibr" id="IDffe10b2c-983d-4d83-b7c1-6d4c3cf3eee0">Farr and Kobrick, 2000</xref>), was used to remove topography from the interferograms. We performed an SBAS processing chain, selecting interferograms having less than 9 months of temporal baseline and less than 500 m of perpendicular baseline. The total number of calculated interferograms was 71. All of them were processed using the JPL/CalTech Repeat Orbit Interferometry Package (ROI_PAC) (<xref rid="ID1e9adff0-645e-4323-a90b-7aa6e89022e6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8c5b7faf-9b5f-4250-a57b-249a56a90c17">Rosen, Hensley, Peltzer, &amp; Simons, 2004</xref>).  A dedicated algorithm was then applied to solve the unwrapping problems of some of the interferograms; including the use of a stack of interferograms and the atmospheric correction of the vertically stratified tropospheric phase (<xref rid="IDd53f5391-9a0e-4fe0-878a-e7ad1a7c0cff" ref-type="bibr" id="ID66e32e49-08a5-44de-be79-477ea8d9d153">Cavali&#233; et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" id="cite1">López-Quiroz et al., 2009</xref>). The 71 interferograms were then inverted to derive the deformation time series of each 30 x 30 m pixel (<xref rid="IDd53f5391-9a0e-4fe0-878a-e7ad1a7c0cff" ref-type="bibr" id="ID66e32e49-08a5-44de-be79-477ea8d9d153">Cavali&#233; et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, time deformation series were converted to 38 rasters, representing the cumulated subsidence for dates included in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The first date, 20021122, represents the reference date, so its cumulated subsidence is zero everywhere. The last date, 20070316, represents the cumulated subsidence for the total time span of 4 years and 4 months and is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The latter means that, for each pixel of 30 x 30 m, we have presented and made available, a time series of cumulated subsidence over 38 dates. Further details on the development of the processing steps are described in <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" id="cite1">López-Quiroz, Doin, Tupin, Briole, &amp; Nicolas, 2009</xref>. The main difference with the results presented here is that previously, for each pixel of 30 x 30 m, only the annual subsidence average velocity was presented.</p>

A 3-arc second sampled Digital Elevation Model from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (<xref rid="IDf8c94d0e-587f-49f9-adc4-ff2cef6b13c0" ref-type="bibr" id="IDffe10b2c-983d-4d83-b7c1-6d4c3cf3eee0">Farr and Kobrick, 2000</xref>), was used too. Images were provided by the European Space Agency, by means of a proposal submission through their website. We performed an SBAS processing chain, starting with the selection of the interferograms that needed to be calculated. Those interferograms had less than 9 months of temporal baseline and less than 500 m of perperdicular baseline. The total number of calculated interferograms was 71. All of them were processed using the JPL/CalTech Repeat Orbit Interferometry Package (ROI_PAC) (<xref rid="ID1e9adff0-645e-4323-a90b-7aa6e89022e6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8c5b7faf-9b5f-4250-a57b-249a56a90c17">Rosen et al., 2004</xref>). A dedicated algorithm was then applied to solve the unwrapping problems of some of the interferograms; including the use of a stack of interferograms and the atmospheric correction of the vertically stratified tropospheric phase. 71 interferograms were then inverted to derive the deformation time series of each pixel of 30 x 30 m (<xref rid="IDd53f5391-9a0e-4fe0-878a-e7ad1a7c0cff" ref-type="bibr" id="ID66e32e49-08a5-44de-be79-477ea8d9d153">Cavali&#233; et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, time deformation series were converted, to 38 matrices, representing the cumulated subsidence for the dates included in (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The first date, 20021122 (aaaammdd), represents the reference date, so its cumulated subsidence is zero everywhere. Detailed development of the processing steps can be read on L&#243;pez-Quiroz et al., 2009.</p>

      <title>Results and discussion</title>
        <p>Annual average velocity calculated from time series on some pixels, were compared to selected GPS measurements (<xref rid="IDf3a4847a-909b-4af4-a332-c5a61154c377" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9a8f9bc4-4438-454d-8dc2-72fa76ba32fe">Cabral-Cano et al., 2008</xref>). The overall agreement between both measurements was good, although differences up to 0.023 m/yr were observed, which is well below given error bars (see <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" id="cite1">López-Quiroz, Doin, Tupin, Briole, &amp; Nicolas, 2009</xref>). The discrepancy can be due to the spatial characteristics of the two measurements: GPS estimates subsidence at a point, while SBAS interferometry, used in this work average it for a 30 x 30 m area. However, a more detailed quantitative study would be needed in order to accurately compare both measurements. Maximum cumulated subsidence for the whole time span, occurs in the Nezahualcoyotl (1.66 m) and Tlahuac (1.33 m) areas, where annual average subsidence velocities are 0.38 and 0.31 m/yr, respectively. The complete set of 38 rasters can be used to analyze zones of maximum deformation gradient and to assess damage to urban infrastructure in the city, since differential subsidence can be more dangerous than the magnitude of the annual average subsidence. The rasters were uploaded to a geospatial server and published in an interactive dynamic geo-visualizer, allowing the visualization of the animated series of cumulated subsidence maps.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>With this work, we made available a set of 38 rasters of cumulated subsidence over Mexico City, from 20021122 to 20070316. The dynamic geo-visualizer on the journal platform allows to represent the temporal and spatial evolution of subsidence in Mexico City. With this tool, it is possible to determine which zones of Mexico City and its metropolitan area have accumulated more subsidence and how this process evolved in time. This work may help to identify the subsurface heterogeneities that control the pattern of subsidence and to plan prevention actions in specific areas.</p>

      <title>Software and map design</title>
        <p>Information technologies enable the development of online, real-time, multi-scale, interoperable, open and collaborative monitoring systems for different geospatial products. The dynamic and animated visualization of subsidence and similar information from the geography and geosciences areas, allows to visualize its evolution over time, in order to determine historical trends and possible scenarios of vulnerability and risk, revealing the value of this kind of tools for the scientific knowledge production at international scale.</p>

        <p>Open source Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS GIS), was used to format the 38 cumulated subsidence rasters. ArcGIS by ESRI, was also used to create the project containing the corresponding 38 rasters layers and its related color scale. Geoserver and Geonode were used for the publication of online geospatial data. The geo-visualizer was developed with OpenLayers library and PHP programming Language. All this software is open source.</p>
